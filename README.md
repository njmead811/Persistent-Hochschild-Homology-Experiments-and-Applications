This github contains the experiments for an in-progress paper called "Persistent Reachability in Machine Learning". The three experiments are as follows:

1. An experiment which tests the accuracy of using persistent (Hochschild) homology features in an SVM to classify seizure vs. pre-seizure brain states in epileptic patients
  The folder patient_data contains the CCM correlation matrices of both the average seizure (ictal) and pre-seizure (preictal) brain states of the patients. The file 
2. An experiment that studies the behavior of random weighted graphs
